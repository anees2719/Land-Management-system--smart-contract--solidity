# Land-Management-system--smart-contract--solidity

Land registry in Pakistan as well as in many parts of the world is very slow and cumbersome process. There are also many intermediaries involved in the process of land registration. Developing a system that not only accelerate the process of land registration, but also make it easier for Buyers, Sellers and Government registrars to transfer the land ownership from seller to a new buyer, is only possible by creating a distributed system that store all the transactions made during the process of land buying. In this Project we’ll try to explore the possibilities and problems solved by using a blockchain based system for land ownership transfer. The system that we are trying to implement is based on Ethereum Blockchain that will store all the transactions made during the process of land ownership transfer. This system will solve the problems faced by all the three parties during the land registration and will also remove the intermediaries like property dealers. This system makes the process of land registration resilient and decrease the cases of fraud in the process. Using the system, validation of the lands is also possible as immutable transactions are being stored in the public ledger.

Instructions and Features:
•	Provide name, age and designation of Land Inspector (who deploy the contract). Address of land inspector is who deployed the contract.
